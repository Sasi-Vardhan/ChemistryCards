Periodic Table Card Generator Game
Overview

The Periodic Table Card Generator Game is an educational learning game designed to help students understand chemical elements in a clear and visual way.
Instead of memorizing elements from a textbook, students explore the periodic table through interactive cards that represent each element.

The game focuses on learning by grouping, visual memory, and hands-on interaction.

Target Audience

Students aged 8 to 14

School classrooms

Teachers conducting revision or activities

Self-learners studying chemistry basics

Learning Objectives

By playing this game, students will be able to:

Identify elements by symbol and name

Understand how elements are grouped in the periodic table

Observe similarities between elements in the same group

Remember element properties using short memory hints

Develop confidence in learning chemistry concepts

How the Game Works

The student selects a periodic table group from a dropdown menu.

All elements belonging to that group are generated as cards.

Each element appears exactly once. No elements are missing.

Cards can be customized in size and color.

The generated cards can be downloaded as a PDF for offline use.

Element Cards

Each element card includes:

Element symbol (large and clear)

Element name

Atomic number

Atomic mass

Group name

A short memory line for easy recall

Every card looks slightly different to avoid repetition and improve visual memory.

Customization Features

Users can control how the cards look:

Set custom card width

Set custom card height

Choose background color for cards

Choose border color for cards

This allows the game to be used both on screens and for printed materials.

Group-Based Learning

The game is structured around periodic table groups:

Group 1 to Group 18

Lanthanides

Actinides

When a group is selected, all elements in that group are shown together, helping students clearly see group patterns and similarities.

Download and Offline Learning

The game provides a Download as PDF option.

This allows:

Printing cards for classroom activities

Sharing cards with classmates

Studying without internet access

The PDF preserves card size, layout, and colors.

Educational Benefits

Encourages visual and active learning

Reduces rote memorization

Makes abstract concepts easier to understand

Supports both classroom teaching and self-study

Summary

The Periodic Table Card Generator Game transforms the periodic table into an interactive learning experience.
By combining structured group learning, customization, and downloadable cards, the game helps students understand chemistry in a simple, clear, and engaging way.

Game Rules and Sample Examples
Game Rules
Rule 1: Group Selection

The player must select one periodic table group at a time.
Only elements belonging to the selected group will be displayed.

Rule 2: Complete Group Display

When a group is selected:

All elements in that group must appear

No element should be missing or repeated

This rule ensures correct understanding of periodic table structure.

Rule 3: Card Customization

Before generating cards, the player can:

Set card width and height

Choose background color

Choose border color

These settings apply to all generated cards.

Rule 4: Element Information Integrity

Each card must always show:

Correct symbol

Correct atomic number

Correct atomic mass

Correct group name

No card should contain incomplete or incorrect data.

Rule 5: Download Rule

Cards can only be downloaded as a PDF after they are generated.
If no cards are visible, download is not allowed.

Sample Examples (Color-Based Situations)
Example 1: Alkali Metals (Group 1)

Situation:
A teacher wants students to quickly identify highly reactive metals.

Settings:

Background color: Light red

Border color: Dark red

Card size: Medium

Outcome:
All Group 1 elements (Lithium, Sodium, Potassium, etc.) appear together.
The red color visually reinforces the idea of high reactivity.

Example 2: Halogens (Group 17)

Situation:
A student is revising reactive non-metals.

Settings:

Background color: Light blue

Border color: Blue

Card size: Small

Outcome:
Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, and other halogens appear together.
Blue tones help students mentally separate this group from metals.

Example 3: Noble Gases (Group 18)

Situation:
A teacher explains elements that do not react easily.

Settings:

Background color: Light grey

Border color: Black

Card size: Large

Outcome:
Helium, Neon, Argon, and other noble gases appear together.
Neutral colors reflect their stable and inactive nature.

Example 4: Actinides (Radioactive Elements)

Situation:
Advanced students are learning about radioactive elements.

Settings:

Background color: Pale yellow

Border color: Dark green

Card size: Medium

Outcome:
All actinides appear together with a clear visual distinction.
Color choice helps students quickly identify radioactive elements.

Classroom Use Example

A teacher can:

Select a group

Choose a group-specific color

Generate cards

Download and print the cards

Use them for quizzes, sorting activities, or revision games

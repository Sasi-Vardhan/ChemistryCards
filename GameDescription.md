**Game Description: Periodic Table Card Generator Game**

This game is an educational card-based activity designed to help students understand the periodic table in a visual and interactive way. Instead of learning elements only from a textbook, students create and explore element cards that behave like collectible game cards. The aim is to make learning chemistry feel structured, engaging, and easy to remember.

Purpose of the Game

The main purpose of the game is to help students:

Learn elements group by group

Understand how elements are related within the same group

Remember key properties of each element using short memory hints

Develop curiosity by exploring and collecting element cards

The game is suitable for students between 8 and 14 years of age and can be used in classrooms, labs, or for self-learning at home.

How the Game Works

When the game starts, the student sees a clean screen with simple controls at the top. The student first selects a periodic table group such as Group 1 (Alkali Metals), Group 17 (Halogens), or Group 18 (Noble Gases). Once a group is selected, the game instantly generates cards for every element in that group.

Each element is shown as its own card. No element is skipped. If a group contains six elements, all six appear. If a group contains more, all of them are displayed together.

Element Cards

Every element card contains the most important information needed at the school level:

Element symbol shown clearly at the center

Element name

Atomic number

Atomic mass

Group name

A short memory line to help students remember the element easily

Each card is slightly different in appearance so that students do not feel they are looking at repeated copies. This helps visual memory and keeps the activity interesting.

Customization by the Student

The game allows students or teachers to change how the cards look:

Card width and height can be adjusted

Background color of cards can be changed

Border color can be changed

This makes the game flexible. Teachers can set large cards for classroom display, while students can use smaller cards for personal practice.

Learning Through Groups

The game is designed around periodic table groups. This helps students understand that:

Elements in the same group have similar properties

Group trends are easier to observe when elements are seen together

The periodic table is organized with a clear structure, not randomly

Special groups like lanthanides and actinides are also included so that students are exposed to the full periodic table.

Download and Offline Use

Once the cards are generated, the student can download them as a PDF file. This allows:

Printing cards for classroom activities

Sharing with other students

Studying offline without the computer

The downloaded file keeps the card size and layout exactly as seen on the screen.

Educational Value

This game supports learning in the following ways:

Visual learning through cards instead of long text

Active learning by letting students choose groups and customize cards

Memory reinforcement using short and simple hints

Better understanding of periodic table structure

The game does not try to replace textbooks. Instead, it works as a learning companion that helps students revise and remember chemistry concepts more effectively.

Classroom and Home Use

Teachers can use the game for:

Group activities

Revision sessions

Project-based learning

Printing element cards for games and quizzes

Students can use it independently to explore elements, revise before exams, or simply learn out of curiosity.

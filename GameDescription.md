# Periodic Table Card Generator Game

## Overview
The Periodic Table Card Generator Game is an educational learning tool designed to help students understand the periodic table in a clear, visual, and interactive way. Instead of memorizing elements from a chart, students explore elements as individual cards grouped by their chemical families. This approach makes chemistry easier to understand and remember.

The game is suitable for students aged 8 to 14 and can be used both in classrooms and at home.

## Objective
The main objectives of the game are:
- To help students learn chemical elements group by group
- To show relationships between elements in the same group
- To improve memory using short, simple learning hints
- To encourage curiosity and independent exploration of chemistry

---

## How the Game Works
1. The user selects a periodic table group from the control panel.
2. All elements belonging to the selected group are generated as cards.
3. Each element is displayed clearly without skipping any element.
4. Cards appear in a grid layout for easy comparison and study.

---

## Element Cards
Each element is represented as a single card containing:
- Element symbol (clearly visible)
- Element name
- Atomic number
- Atomic mass
- Group name
- A short memory line for easy recall

Each card has slight visual differences so that students can distinguish elements easily and avoid confusion.

---

## Customization Options
The game allows users to customize the cards:
- Adjust card width
- Adjust card height
- Change card background color
- Change card border color

These options make the game adaptable for classroom display, printing, or personal study.

---

## Group-Based Learning
The game focuses on learning through periodic table groups:
- All elements in a selected group are shown together
- Group similarities become easier to observe
- Special groups such as lanthanides and actinides are included

This structure helps students understand why the periodic table is organized in groups.

## Download and Offline Use
The game provides a download option that allows users to:
- Save generated cards as a PDF file
- Print element cards for offline study
- Share study material with classmates

The downloaded PDF preserves the card layout and dimensions.

## Educational Benefits
This game supports learning by:
- Encouraging visual learning through cards
- Reducing reliance on rote memorization
- Reinforcing memory using short hints
- Helping students understand periodic trends

The game is designed as a learning aid and works best when used alongside textbooks.

## Classroom and Home Usage
Teachers can use the game for:
- Classroom activities
- Revision sessions
- Group discussions
- Project-based learning

Students can use the game for:
- Self-study
- Exam revision
- Exploring chemistry concepts independently
